about git
Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history.
GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.
So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.
about repositpry
stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure.
A historical record of changes in the repository.
A set of commit objects.
A set of references to commit objects, called heads.
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically
git branch -----
This creates a new pointer to the same commit you’re currently on.
